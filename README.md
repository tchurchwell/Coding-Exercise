 
The agile testing coding exercise is designed to demonstrate an agile tester's ability to use a real IDE, write code, do OOD, refactor, test-drive, learn open-source automated testing frameworks and tools and generally be productive pairing with developers on agile teams. 

Along the way, other attributes indirectly tested include natural curiosity, passion, autodidacticism, courage, leadership, communication skills, and attention to detail. 

 To get started with the exercise, you will need to have:
  
•  Something to edit Java code (such as the Eclipse IDE)

•	A Subversion client (such as the Subclipse plugin for Eclipse)

•	A way to run TestNG unit tests (such as the TestNG plugin for Eclipse)
 
Download and install Eclipse.  Install a Subversion Client and then after setting up your Subversion client, check out the coding exercise project from:

Go to the project folder and then open and read the README file. It contains instructions for how to work on the individual exercises. You need not complete every individual exercise, but please finish as many as you conveniently can. The more work you do, the easier it is for us to assess your level of skill and experience.

After you're finished, zip up the entire project with all of your changes (please include your name in the name of the .zip file) and send it back to us. We will contact you after evaluating the results.
