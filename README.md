 
The agile testing coding exercise is designed to demonstrate an agile tester's ability to use a real IDE, write code, do OOD, refactor, test-drive, learn open-source automated testing frameworks and tools and generally be productive pairing with developers on agile teams. 

Along the way, other attributes indirectly tested include natural curiosity, passion, autodidacticism, courage, leadership, communication skills, and attention to detail. 

 To get started with the exercise, you will need to have:
  
•  Something to edit Java code (such as the Eclipse IDE)

•	A Subversion client (such as the Subclipse plugin for Eclipse)

•	A way to run TestNG unit tests (such as the TestNG plugin for Eclipse)
 
Download and install Eclipse.  Install a Subversion Client and then after setting up your Subversion client, check out the coding exercise
